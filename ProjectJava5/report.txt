1. Hours to complete the project: 20-25 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Brute-force Implementation): The first problem for this project 
   was very simple, also by having gone to SI with Kyler. This problem took 
   just a amsll amount of time.

   Problem 2 (2d-tree Implementation): This problem was the most tough
   ptoblem i have ever faced. This problem took a lot of time and i 
   had the problem of not gettig the right 5 first values and had to
   check through everything until i noticed i had a small mistake in my 
   put method. The debugging was a pain to come to the conclusion that there
   was a problem with my put method.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Philipp            Brother               Helped me when i got
                                            stuck and helped me debug
                                            the code.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   this project was not so fun because it was too diffuclt, i had to get lots of help
   and that was not.
