4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   It was a tough first approach at the first project and had a lot of trouble understanding what i needed to do for all the metheods also starting off with java. I made a mistake of not reading through everything carefully and fell behind on information that would help me on the project. I felt really pressured having to do 1 project and hw at the same time.
