1. Hours to complete the project: 15-20 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (WordNet Data Type): public wordNet was a bit difficult but
   having gone to SI helped me solve that method.The program would not
   run because i needed to do ShortestCommonAncestor in order for WordNet
   to be able to run.

   Problem 2 (ShortestCommonAncestor Data Type): This problem was also
   a bit challenging but lots of the methods were the same just the return 
   result was different. It took some time to understand the ancestor and
   the length.

   Problem 3 (Outcast Data Type): this was not too bad. The public String
   outcast was a bit of a challenge but for this problem i had the least
   errors and bugs that needed to be fixed 

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Philipp            Brother               Helped me when i got
                                            stuck and helped me debug
                                            the code.        

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project was more straight forward, which i liked. it just took time
   to understand how this wordnet works, the ancestor the distance ext. 
   I enjoyed this project more than most projects we have done so far.
