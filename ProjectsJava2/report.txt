1. Hours to complete the project: 20-25 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Deque): I had trouble understanding Node and how it works. 
   It was diffuclt for to see what was going on in this problem.
   There is a pointer going left(prev) and right(next). Once getting to
   understand what the problem LinkedDeque.java wanted me to do it got a
   lot easier. I stilldifficulty writing some of the code for some part
   of this problem and bugs and simple mistakes. 

   Problem 2 (Random Queue): ResizingRandomQueue was a bit more 
   challenging. Again just like Problem one its all about understanding
   what you need, to doand that took alot of time as well. The hardest 
   part of this problem was being able to add items to the queue and 
   removing random Index elements in thequeue.

   Problem 3 (Subset): This was the most easy part, since i had already the 
   ResizingRandomQueue.java, problem # 2 of the project.
   I had the problem of not realizing that if my ResizingRandomQueue.java 
   is in the same directory then i would just need
   to call in the file without having to import or do anything special.
   
3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Philipp            Brother          Helped me when i got
                                       stuck and helped me debug
                                       the code.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I understood this project a better than Percolation.Java but again this was 
   another diffcult task that took a lot of time to complete.
