1. Hours to complete the project: 10-15 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Autocomplete Term): This problem was not too difficult, but
    starting it was little difficult. The Comparator<Term> was a bit diffuclt to 
    understand. Otherwise the rest of the probelm was not too much 
    trouble to figure out. I learned how to different kind of (if)
    statements in java.

   Problem 2 (Binary Search Deluxe): The first and last key index was very
   similar which was also hinted to us. I created a new method called 
   binarySearch which goes throught the binary search once so i dont have 
   write the same code two times for both first and last and then put this
   method into the fist and last IndexOf. The wording of the problem was
   a bit diffuclt to understand talking about keys as indexes. When i think
   of key i think of a dictionary.

   Problem 3 (Autocomplete): Auto complete was a bit more tricky figuring out
   how it works and i got a lot of bugs which took some reaserch and help
   to debug.
   
3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Philipp           brother        Helped me when i got
                                    stuck and helped me debug
                                    the code.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project went a bit faster to do since there was less code to write
   and doing autocomplete was also a bit fun to do. I like this project the 
   best out of the first 3 we have done this semester.
